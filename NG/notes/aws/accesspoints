A way of getting data from our s3 bucket; or "accessing objects" is through a access point.  It takes the form of  a hostname.  An access point could have restrictions.

Restrictions set up by:
1/ network origin control  (block ip's? )
2/ Block Public Access Control

VPC - virtual private cloud
each acces point contains a unique DNS name
