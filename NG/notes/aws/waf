1/ to get started with WAF you create a "web ACL"

2/ in order to associate the acl to your cloud distribution,
(this is confusing),
	a/ step1
	add name, description as you see fit
	**b/ RESOURCE TYPE
		1. choose "CloudFront distributions"
	**c/ ASSOCIATED AWS resources- optional
		1. I typed in the s3 bucket associated with the cloudfront 		distribution:
		aolss3test
		2. click "add AWS resources"
** it brings you to the page where you cloud distribution shows up
and you can click on the box to select it, then press "add"

	b/ step 2 - add rules
		1. choose "add my own rules and rule groups"
		2. rule type - choose  IP set

IP set is "Evie_only"
