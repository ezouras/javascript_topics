While TCP contains information about what data has or has not yet been received, HTTP contains specific instructions on how to read and process this data once it arrives

/////////////
TCP - connection oriented. Establishes a connection before sending data
- extensive error checking
	-flow control
	-acknowledgement of data
	-sequencing of data
- reliable - guarantees delivery of data
- MUC SLOWER than udp
- heavy weight
- does not support broadcasting
- http , https, ftp smtp and telnet
- uses "handshake"
	-> request syn
	<-- sync ack
	---> ack


UDP - connetinoless oriented - does not establish a connectino before sending data
- used for time sensitive transmission
	- video playback
	- dns
-packets COUDL get lost
- sends data to a target without establishing a connection
- request the send send send without acknowlege
	- can be open to attacks and attacker can send "spoof" packest since there is no check
