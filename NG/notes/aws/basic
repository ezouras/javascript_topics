SAM - the AWS serverless Application model.
framework for building serverless apps.

Cloud Formation - AWS tool for deploying  infrastructure.
 You describe your desired infrastructure in YAML or JSON, then submit your CloudFormation template for deployment. It enables "infrastructure as code".

The Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an extension to CloudFormation within AWS. It provides a way to use CloudFormation syntax to define your Serverless Applications with the addition of three new CloudFormation resources Function, API, Table, though it can only be used within the AWS ecosystem.

Terraform is an unopinionated cloud deployment tool. It describes Infrastructure as Code and deploys to multiple clouds and SaaS systems at once. It is comparable to CloudFormation but for multiple clouds.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time that you consume

 Lambda provides runtimes for Node.js that run your code to process events. Your code runs in an environment that includes the AWS SDK for JavaScript, with credentials from an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you manage.  you don't need a server to run the node, you can use lambda

Label - There are times an EC2 instance or AGENT is spun to run something for you, this "agent" is represented by a "label"
