DNS / private hosts


/etc/hosts file
mappings of hostnames to IP that gets established

Difference between a hostname and a domain name:

hostname: name given to a machine or endpoint.
if I go to cmd prompt I can type in
hostname
and get a name for my computer.

domain: name given to the "network"


When you purchase a "domain name" , you are really purchasing a name for a host on a domain.
.com is the domain in which you purchase a name for.
.net is another domain you could purchase a name for
<machine_name>.<domain>

The internet is a large public network.
my home is a private network that has a router.
