Could not get angular to recognize 'cyptograph' - and importing 
it in the component did not work in the traditional way.

1/ find out where the libraries .min.js file is located:
	a/ for cypto go to node_modules->cytoscape -> dist ->cytoscape.min.js

2/ import it into angular.json file as a value for the "scripts" property:
	a/ {projects:{
		<projects-name>:{
     			 "architect": {
      				 "build": {
					"options": {           
						"scripts": [
	<location of js files you need to use in project>
              "node_modules/cytoscape/dist/cytoscape.min.js",
              "node_modules/dagre/dist/dagre.min.js",
              "node_modules/cytoscape-dagre/cytoscape-dagre.js"
            ]

3/ in the file that I used cytoscape I "declared" it like this:

	import { Component, OnChanges, Renderer2, ElementRef, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

//put this right under your imports. It's a sort of import
declare var cytoscape: any;
