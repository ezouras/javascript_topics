# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine, as well as Yarn:

    npm install -g @angular/cli yarn


# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/angular-university/angular-advanced-course.git
    
This repository is made of several separate npm modules, that are installable separately. For example, to run the au-input module, we can do the following:
    
    cd angular-advanced-course/au-input
    yarn

Its also possible to install the modules as usual using npm:

    npm install 

Yarn has the big advantage that if you use it you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, please post the complete error message in the Questions section of the course.

# To Run the Development Server

We can start the chat  application with the following command:

    npm start

  The application is visible at port 4200 - [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

# Installing branches other than master

At certain points along the course, you will be asked to checkout other remote branches other than master. You can view all branches that you have available remotely using the following command:

    git branch -a

  The remote branches have their starting in origin, such as for example au-input.

We can checkout the remote branch and start tracking it with a local branch that has the same name, by using the following command:

      git checkout -b au-input origin/au-input
