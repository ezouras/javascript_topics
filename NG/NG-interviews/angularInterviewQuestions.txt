1 / why angular ?

  as an applicatnio grows, the code gets more tedioux and complex
with jquery and vanilla javascript.

javascript separates concerns



framework that binds html ui and javascript model.
why is this important ? help you reduce your effort on writing
long lines of code
for binding.catch

so instead of document.getId("de");
to get something from the html into the javascript page,
then modify it;
you can access it directly in angular

View - html
model - object in javascript

viewmodel - angular.the middle place where the MOdel
can talk to the view.
angular = mvx - model, view etc.
IT IS A BINDING FRAMEWORK

2 / how does angular work
angular.json contains the configuration of the app
1. where the entry point of the app "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
    "options": {
      "outputPath": "dist/angular-starter",
      "index": "src/index.html",
      "main": "src/main.ts",
      -- > entry point

      2. style files to use

      "styles": [
          "src/styles.scss",
          "node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css",

          or preprocessor type style engines

          "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
            "includePaths": [
              "src/styles"
            ]
            2. main.ts creates the browser environment and
            bootstraps app.module.ts
3 / what does app.module.ts do
              a.it declares all the components that will be used
            b.it bootstraps app.componet.ts
            @NgModule({
              declarations: [
                AppComponent
              ],
              imports: [
                BrowserModule
              ],
              providers: [],
              entryComponents: [],
              bootstrap: [AppComponent]
            })
