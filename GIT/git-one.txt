1/ pulling changes from remote master
Git pull - -rebase
<that dash dash rebase. NOT one dash>

2/ create a new branch and push everything to your new branch
Scenario: I cloned a repository and made a bunch of changes.
They want those changes to go to a new branch.
>git checkout -b <name of branch>
Which is short for:
>git branch <name of branch> = create the branch
>git checkout <name of branch> = change to that branch
>git branch = show all branches
The branch you are on with have a *
Create the branch on the reposotiry and push it
$ git push --set-upstream origin <name of new branch>

$ git push --set-upstream origin newEndpointForTableData

3/ pushing branch changes to master
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge test
git push origin master

4/ clone ONE branch only.  Clone a SPECIFIC branch
git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>
git clone –single-branch –branch newHomePage   https://pig.abbvienet.com/ir-search-platform/pikm.git

************ Errors encountered *********************

Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge…
Auto-merging src/app/results/results.component.ts
CONFLICT (content): Merge confict in src/app/results/results.component.ts
Error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Hint: use “git am –show-current-patch’ to see the failed patch.
Patch failed at 0001  - “message for new commit”..
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
>git add/rm <conflicted_files>”, then run
>git rebase –continue
5/ merge changes from a branch off of your branch
	In the pikm project, my branch: newHomePage
	Adam branched off of that branch: newResultsPage
You can verify these branches by going to github and view the branches for that project.
make sure you checkout the branch you want to merge into.
a/ I want to merge into newHomePage.
b/ I want to merge the branch “newResultsPage” into “newHomePage”
>git checkout newHomePage
>git status
You should see an astrich next to “newHomePage”

 merge the branch into “newHomePage”
>git merge newResultsPage


6/ I can’t see the release branch or a branch on my local repository:
1/ git fetch -all
2/ git branch
If you still don’t see it, do a
3/ git checkout <exact name of branch>
Switched to a new branch 'release'
Branch 'release' set up to track remote branch 'release' from 'origin'.

It will link to that remove branch anyway
$ git status
On branch release
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/release'.

Merge your master branch changes into the release branch
a/ I want to merge into newHomePage.
b/ I want to merge the branch “newResultsPage” into “newHomePage”
>git checkout newHomePage
>git status
You should see an astrich next to “newHomePage”

 merge the branch into “newHomePage”
>git merge newResultsPage
