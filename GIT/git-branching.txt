Git branching
1/ create a new branch and switch to it
Git checkout -b branch br1
Same as
Git branch br1
Git checkout br1

1/ make sure you checkout the branch you want to merge into.
a/ I want to merge into newHomePage.
b/ I want to merge the branch “newResultsPage” into “newHomePage”
>git checkout newHomePage
>git status
You should see an astrich next to “newHomePage”
2/ merge the branch into “newHomePage”
>git merge newResultsPage

3/ merging to and from LOCAL branches
merge changes from local_branch TO master
git checkout master
git merge local_branch
merge changes from master TO local_branch
git checkout local_branch
git merge master
